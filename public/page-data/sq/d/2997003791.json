Determining the best places to visit may depend on your interests and the type of trip you're hoping to create.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"CDN-BC-BCV\" class=\"sitename\">1. Vancouver</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/vancouver.jpeg\" alt=\"Vancouver\" /></p>\r\n<p>For beauty, climate, a fun atmosphere, and plenty of things to do, you can't go wrong planning a trip to Vancouver. Set on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and backed by snow-capped mountains, this is an active city, where locals enjoy the outdoors year-round.</p>\r\n<p>Sunbathers can bask on the beaches in summer, and skiers can hit the nearby ski resorts in winter. At any time of year, you can walk the seawall or stroll through the towering trees in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.planetware.com/vancouver/stanley-park-vancouver-cdn-bc-bcvsp.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stanley Park</a>, enjoy fine dining or a casual meal while watching the sunset, or find fabulous shopping, from the markets of<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Granville Island</b><span>&nbsp;</span>to the high-end shops in the city center.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"CDN-ON-ONNF\" class=\"sitename\">2. Niagara Falls</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/niagara-falls.jpeg\" alt=\"Niagara Falls\" /></p>\r\n<p>Canada's most famous natural attraction, the majestic Niagara Falls has been drawing sightseers almost since its discovery. The great wall of water pounding over the falls is an amazing sight, and the view and access afforded visitors is astounding. You can literally walk up to the edge of the falls, separated only by a cast-iron railing, and see the water as it disappears over the crest.</p>\r\n<p>The city that has developed here, also named Niagara Falls, has been greatly influenced by the people and atmosphere the falls have created. Stuntmen and daredevils have been tempting their fate on the falls throughout the decades, and as a result, a carnival-style atmosphere has come to define this unique city. Just a short drive from Toronto, Niagara Falls is easy to reach, and the city is a fun place to spend a day or two.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Toronto</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/toronto.jpeg\" alt=\"Toronto\" /></p>\r\n<p>As Canada's largest city, Toronto is the country's cultural hot spot, with ballet, opera, symphony, and Broadway shows. It's also home to the landmark<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>CN Tower</strong>. Add extraordinary shopping, fine dining, and fantastic museums, and there is no end to the entertainment.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, Toronto's waterfront has experienced ongoing development and now boasts beautiful walking areas, restaurants, and in summer, outdoor concerts and cultural performances.</p>\r\n<p>Just outside the city center, in either direction from the city, are beautiful beaches, perfect on hot summer days. In winter, a public skating rink springs to life outside city hall, and unique winter events, including the popular<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Winterlicious</b>, add to the fun. You can find<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.planetware.com/canada/top-rated-ski-resorts-near-toronto-cdn-1-197.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ski resorts near Toronto<span>&nbsp;</span></a>as well.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Montreal</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/montreal.jpeg\" alt=\"Montreal\" /></p>\r\n<p>Montreal is a unique city, with a beautiful old historic district dating back to the 1600s and a modern city center with extensive underground shopping.<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Old Montreal</b><span>&nbsp;</span>is the main tourist hub, with cobbled streets and fantastic old buildings.</p>\r\n<p>Montreal is also home to a large number of fashion designers, and high-end boutiques line the historic streets, along with quaint hotels and restaurants. Located in the French-speaking<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/quebec-province-cdn-qu-qu.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">province of Qu&eacute;bec</a>, Montreal has its own cultural identity, but English-speaking visitors will have no trouble communicating with anyone in the tourist industry.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Banff</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/banff.jpeg\" alt=\"Banff\" /></p>\r\n<p>The charming mountain town of Banff, in the stunning<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Banff National Park</b>, is a must-visit destination for anyone looking to explore the Rocky Mountains and see some of the most beautiful scenery in Canada. This is undeniably a tourist town, catering to international travelers from all over the globe.</p>\r\n<p>Just a short distance from the town is&nbsp;Lake Louise Ski Resort&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sunshine Village Ski Resort, two of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.planetware.com/canada/top-rated-ski-resorts-in-canada-cdn-1-65.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canada's best ski resorts</a>. In summer, the nearby turquoise lakes, including Lake Louise, and glacier-capped mountains are a glorious sight.</p>\r\n<p>But you don't even need to leave the town to enjoy a gondola ride to the top of a mountain for dinner, soak in a hot spring-fed pool, find fabulous shopping, discover lovely walking trails, and possibly see elk and woodland caribou that frequently make their way into town.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.planetware.com/canada/best-places-to-visit-in-canada-cdn-1-12.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Article Source</a></p>\r\n<p></p>","category":{"contentid":110}},"sitemapNode":{"path":"/blog/am-eh-zing-places-to-visit-in-canada"},"linkedContent_agilityCategory":{"customFields":{"title":"Travel Guide"}}},{"customFields":{"title":"Travel Photography Tips: 101","date":"March 23, 2021","image":{"url":"https://cdn.aglty.io/ngvqh3wz/posts/travel-photography_20210331143648_0.jpg","label":"Travel Photography 101"},"content":"<p class=\"\">Photographs are often the best souvenir of your travels. But the worst thing is when they come out blurry, blown out, or just not all that exciting to look at.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">If you want to learn how to take better pictures on your travels around the world, this article is packed with everything you need to improve your photography skills.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Set your camera to shoot in burst mode</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/whale-watching.jpg\" alt=\"Whale Watching\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Setting your camera to \"burst\" mode means that several shots will be taken with a single click of the shutter. This is especially helpful when you&rsquo;re trying to take an action shot, like a whale breaching the water&rsquo;s surface.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Also, burst mode is a good idea when handing your camera to a stranger to take your photo. You will get several to choose from, instead of just one where you&rsquo;re blinking and someone is photo-bombing in the background. I always have my camera set in burst mode so we can choose our favorite photo from a series.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>2. Carry a small tripod</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/beach-sunset.jpeg\" alt=\"Beach Sunset\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">A tripod will seriously up your photo-taking game. There are several reasons for this but one of the main reasons we carry a tripod is so we can get shots of epic landscapes with ourselves in the picture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">If you're in a remote location, there might not be anyone around to take your photo. And even when there are tons of people around, they might not take shots you&rsquo;re happy with. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">When you travel with a tripod, you can always get a great photo of yourself because you are in control.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Shoot early and late</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/kyoto-sunset.jpeg\" alt=\"Kyoto Sunset\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">No matter how talented of a photographer you may be, there are certain times of the day where your shot just won&rsquo;t look as good. For instance, during the middle of the day when the sun is at its peak in the sky, the light is harsh and your photos will tend to have strong shadows. Instead, aim to take photos when the sun is low in the sky and it'll cast a warm glow instead of harsh white light.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">The most ideal times of the day to take photos are in the morning just after sunrise, and during that magical &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo; just before sunset. Try to arrive at locations you want to shoot during these times. Of course there are many times when you can&rsquo;t arrive at the ideal time, but it&rsquo;s a good rule to follow whenever possible.</p>\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid of a little rain (or clouds!)</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/raindrop-flowers.jpeg\" alt=\"Rain Droplets on Flowers\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Cloudy days can sometimes be disappointing when you&rsquo;re on vacation, but they often make for the most interesting photos. Clouds soften the sun&rsquo;s light, acting like a natural light box, and make it possible for you to get great shots even in the peak of the afternoon. They can also create a cool, moody effect and can make your pictures more interesting than if you have a clear blue sky.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Much the same, many people get nervous to take their camera out in the rain. But rainy shots can be super interesting.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Get a different perspective</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.aglty.io/gixkprai/posts/taj-mahal-unique-prespective.jpeg\" alt=\"Taj Mahal Unique Prespective\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">It can be a good idea to get inspiration by searching online for famous shots of iconic places. For instance, a quick Google search of &ldquo;Taj Mahal&rdquo; will show you the most famous angles this landmark is shot from.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">But in order to really improve your photography skills, do the OPPOSITE. When everybody is taking pictures to the right, turn left. Look up. Look down. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get down on the ground and shoot from below.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Walk to a less crowded side of the landmark and take a picture from that lesser-seen angle, like the photo of the Taj Mahal above.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/32-easy-creative-travel-photography-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Article Source</a></p>","category":{"contentid":109}},"sitemapNode":{"path":"/blog/travel-photography-101"},"linkedContent_agilityCategory":{"customFields":{"title":"Travel Tips"}}}]}}}
